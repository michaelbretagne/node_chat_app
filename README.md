## Node-chat-app | A real-time chat app

Users can **login** into a room and start **instant messaging** with their peers. They can also share their location by clicking on the "send location" button.<br>
For now, this app is very basic but it is functional as is. More features to come.<br>



For this project, I used **Socket.io**. It enables **realtime**, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.<br>It's made up of the client-side library that runs in the browser, and the server-side library for Node.js.


## **Node packages used:**

- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express): The backend part of the MEAN stack.
- [moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io): Lightweight JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates.
- [socket.io](): Enable synchronized bilateral exchanges between the client and the server.
- [expect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/expect) : Lets you write better assertions.
- [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha): A flexible JavaScript test framework for node.js and the browser.
- [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon): Utility that monitors for any changes in the source and automatically restarts the server.
